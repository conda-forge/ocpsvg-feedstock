    # The libgl dependency for the test section can likely be removed when
    # the following https://github.com/conda-forge/ocp-feedstock/pull/50
    # gets merged in the ocp feedstock
    # this helps avoid a yum dependency
    # either with the yum dependency or with this, the end user is assumed
    # to have X11 system dependencies installed
    # this helps the user avoid to have a direct dependency on libgl
    # from this package (it will be transitive from OCP once the PR gets merged)
    - libgl    # [linux]
